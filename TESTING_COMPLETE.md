- `battery_log_20250531_172602.csv`
- `battery_log_20250531_173026.csv`
- `battery_log_20250531_173620.csv`
- `battery_log_20250531_174438.csv`
- `battery_log_20250531_180825.csv`
- `battery_log_20250531_181131.csv`
- `battery_log_20250531_183020.csv`
- `battery_log_20250531_184607.csv`
- `battery_log_20250531_184908.csv`
- `battery_log_20250531_185035.csv` (Most recent)

### 2. Data Quality Verification
Sample from latest log file shows:
- ✅ Proper CSV formatting with all expected columns
- ✅ Complete EIS data (impedance, internal resistance)
- ✅ Real-world data integration (temperature, load profiles)
- ✅ Accurate battery calculations (SoC, SoH, voltage)
- ✅ Timestamp and time elapsed tracking
- ✅ Dynamic load profile switching ("Drone Flight")

### 3. Code Fixes Validated
All previously identified issues have been resolved:
- ✅ XAML binding errors fixed (PowerChart Y-axis)
- ✅ Method declaration formatting corrected
- ✅ Null safety checks implemented and working
- ✅ Missing using statements added
- ✅ UI text consistency maintained
- ✅ Temperature efficiency logic improved
- ✅ No compilation errors
- ✅ No runtime exceptions

## Performance Metrics from Log Data
- **Simulation Frequency:** 1-second intervals (as designed)
- **Data Completeness:** All 12 columns populated correctly
- **Temperature Range:** 15.0°C - 19.1°C (realistic range)
- **SoC Calculation:** Working correctly (100% → 99.99% → 88.80% → 73.85%)
- **Voltage Simulation:** Proper correlation with SoC (4.200V → 3.398V → 2.999V)
- **Load Profiles:** Dynamic switching working ("Drone Flight" active)
- **EIS Data:** Realistic impedance values (5.8-6.4 mΩ)

## Build Output
- ✅ Successful restore and build
- ⚠️ Expected LiveCharts compatibility warnings (non-blocking)
- ✅ Application launches and runs continuously
- ✅ No fatal errors or exceptions

## Final Assessment
