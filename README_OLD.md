- **Fault Detection System**: Automated alerts for:
  - Low SoC warning (below 10%)
  - Overvoltage alert (above 4.2V)
  - Undervoltage alert (below 3.0V)
  - Critical SoH warning (below 80%)
- **Enhanced Data Visualization**: Dual-panel chart display with 60-second rolling window

## Technical Specifications

- **Framework**: .NET 6 with Windows-specific targeting
- **UI Framework**: WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation)
- **Charting Library**: LiveCharts.Wpf v0.9.7
- **IDE**: Visual Studio 2022 (Community, Professional, or Enterprise)
- **OS Requirements**: Windows 10 or 11
- **Hardware**: Minimum 4GB RAM

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. Windows 10 or 11
2. Visual Studio 2022 with .NET 6 SDK
3. WPF workload installed in Visual Studio

### Running the Application

1. Open the solution in Visual Studio 2022
2. Build the solution (Ctrl+Shift+B)
3. Run the application (F5 or Ctrl+F5)

### Using the Simulator

1. **Set Parameters**:
   - **Capacity (Ah)**: Battery capacity in Ampere-hours
   - **Initial SoC (%)**: Starting State of Charge percentage (0-100)
   - **Current (A)**: Base discharge current in Amperes (will be randomized during simulation)

2. **Start Simulation**: Click "Start Simulation" to begin real-time calculations

3. **Monitor Progress**: Watch real-time updates:
   - **SoC**: Decreases based on dynamic discharge rate using Coulomb counting
   - **SoH**: Degrades by 0.1% per cycle (every 10 seconds)
   - **Charts**: Live visualization of SoC and voltage trends
   - **Current Load**: Dynamic current displayed in window title (varies 50-150% of base)

4. **Fault Monitoring**: Automatic alerts for:
   - Low battery warnings
   - Voltage anomalies
   - Battery health degradation

5. **Data Logging**: CSV files are automatically created with timestamped filenames:
   - Format: `battery_log_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv`
   - Contains comprehensive battery state data with dynamic current values

6. **Stop Simulation**: Click "Stop Simulation" to halt the process or wait for automatic stop at 0% SoC

## Calculation Methods

### SoC Calculation (Coulomb Counting)
```
SoC = Initial SoC - (Current Ã— Time / 3600) / Capacity Ã— 100
```

### SoH Calculation (Cycle-based Degradation)
```
SoH = 100 - (Cycle Count Ã— 0.1)
```

### Voltage Simulation
```
Voltage = 3.7 - (0.3 Ã— (100 - SoC) / 100)
```

Where:
- **Current**: Discharge current in Amperes (A)
- **Time**: Elapsed time in seconds (converted to hours)
- **Capacity**: Battery capacity in Ampere-hours (Ah)
- **SoC**: State of Charge as a percentage (%)
- **SoH**: State of Health as a percentage (%)
- **Cycle Count**: Number of battery cycles (incremented every 10 seconds)
